LibraryManagement.api
c#

Installation
Navigate to the LibraryManagementSystem.Api directory:
cd path/to/your/repo/LibraryManagementSystem.Api
Restore dependencies:
dotnet restore
Database Setup
Configure Connection String:
Open appsettings.json (and appsettings.Development.json).
Update the DefaultConnection string to connect to your local SQL Server instance.
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=YourServerName;Database=LibraryDb;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;TrustServerCertificate=True"
},
Remember to replace YourServerName.
Apply Migrations:
Open a terminal in the LibraryManagementSystem.Api directory.
Run the following command to create the database and apply all pending migrations:
dotnet ef database update
If you need to create initial migrations or manage them:
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate (only if no migrations exist)
dotnet build
Configuration
JWT Settings:
In appsettings.json, configure your JWT settings. In a production environment, ensure the Key is very strong and secured (e.g., via environment variables).
"Jwt": {
  "Issuer": "LibraryAppIssuer",
  "Audience": "LibraryAppAudience",
  "Key": "ThisIsAVeryStrongAndSecretKeyForJwtAuthenticationWhichShouldBeLongEnough"
},
CORS Policy:
Open Program.cs.
Ensure the CORS policy named _myAllowSpecificOrigins is configured to allow requests from your frontend's URL (http://localhost:3000).
Verify the order of middleware: app.UseCors() must be called before app.UseAuthentication() and app.UseAuthorization().
Running the API
From terminal:
dotnet run
From Visual Studio:
Open the LibraryManagementSystem.Api.csproj in Visual Studio.
Press F5 to run the application.
Upon running, the API will typically open its Swagger UI in your default browser (e.g., https://localhost:7086/swagger). This interface allows you to test all API endpoints directly.

API Endpoints (Swagger)
Once the API is running, you can access the Swagger UI at https://localhost:7086/swagger (replace port if different).

How It Works
This application follows a client-server architecture.

Authentication Flow
User Registration: New users can register by providing a username, email, and password. This data is sent to the backend's /api/Auth/register endpoint. The backend creates a new user in the database.
User Login: Registered users can log in by providing their username and password to the /api/Auth/login endpoint.
JWT Issuance: Upon successful login, the backend generates a JWT (JSON Web Token) and sends it back to the frontend.
Token Storage: The frontend stores this token in the browser's localStorage.
Authorized Requests: For all subsequent requests to protected API endpoints (e.g., getting books, adding borrowers), the frontend includes this JWT in the Authorization header as a Bearer token.
Backend Validation: The backend validates the received token to ensure the request is from an authenticated and authorized user.
Library Management Operations
Once logged in, the application presents a dashboard with three main tabs: Books, Borrowers, and Loans.

Books:

Users can view a list of all books.
Add Book: A form allows adding new books with details like Title, Author, ISBN, Publication Year, Genre, and Availability. The ISBN must be between 10 and 13 characters for validation.
Edit Book: Existing book details can be updated.
Delete Book: Books can be removed from the system.
(Note: Two default books are automatically added to the database on the first load of the Books tab if they don't already exist).
Borrowers:

Users can view a list of all registered borrowers.
Add Borrower: A form allows adding new borrowers with Name and Contact Info (Email).
Edit Borrower: Existing borrower details can be updated.
Delete Borrower: Borrowers can be removed.
Loans:

Users can view all loan records (active and returned).

Borrow Book: A form allows creating a new loan by selecting an available book and an existing borrower.

Return Book: Active loans can be marked as returned.

Delete Loan: Loan records can be deleted.

Technologies Used
Backend
ASP.NET Core Web API: For building robust and scalable APIs.
C#: The primary programming language.
Entity Framework Core: ORM for database interaction (Code-First approach).
SQL Server: Relational database to store library data.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure user authentication and authorization.
Frontend
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
HTML5/CSS3: For structuring and styling the web pages.
JavaScript (ES6+): Programming language for frontend logic.
Fetch API: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
